      <h2>About Elena</h2>
      <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        Elena believes chess isn't about memorizing moves—it's about
        understanding patterns and thinking clearly. Her goal is to help you see
        the board the way strong players do, one concept at a time. Too many
        students get lost in endless opening theory or tactical puzzles without
        grasping the fundamental principles that tie everything together. She
        focuses on building your intuition and decision-making skills so you can
        play confidently in any position. When you understand the 'why' behind
        each move, improvement becomes natural and enjoyable.
